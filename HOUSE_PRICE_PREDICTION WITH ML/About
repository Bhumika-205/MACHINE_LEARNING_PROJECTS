House Price Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to estimate the selling price of a house based on features like the number of bedrooms, 
bathrooms, area in square feet, and location. By analyzing historical housing data, the model learns the relationship between these factors and the final price. 
Using regression algorithms, it can predict prices for new or unseen properties. This helps buyers, sellers, and real estate agents make informed decisions. 
The project is implemented using Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and visualized using tools like Matplotlib or Streamlit for easy user interaction.
